# Rails: Up and Running

Rails: Up and Running is perfect for beginning web developers, going through
the basics of installing and using Rails 2.1. It should be noted, however,
that rails is currently up to 5.0.0.1 (So, some methods may be depricated).

An interesting read for those of you who like to read docs in your spare time!
I personally actually enjoy it as a pastime.
