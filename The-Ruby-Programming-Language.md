# The Ruby Programming Language

**@author:** David Flanagan, Yukihiro Matsumoto

**@owner:** [Byron Mejia](https://github.com/byronmejia/)

This guide will step through the ruby programming language (that is: API 1.9),
dealing from the lexical and syntactic structure of ruby programs all the
way to reflection and metaprogramming. Many of the things learnt from the book
are still relevant today, although Ruby is currently at 2.3.\*.
